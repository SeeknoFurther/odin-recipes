        <h3>Preparation</h3>
          <oi>
              <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees</li>
              <li>Heat the olive oil in a large dutch oven.  Add bacon
                  and cook over medium heat 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally until
                  the bacon is lightly browned.  Remove the bacon with a slotted spoonto a large plate
              </li>
              <li>Dry the beef cubes with paper towls and then sprinkle them with salt and pepper.
                  In batches in single layers, sear the beef in hot oil for 3 to 5 mintues, to brown on
                  all sides.  Remove the seared cubes to the plate with the bacon and continue searing until all the beef is 
                  browned.
              </li>
              <li>Toss the carrots, onions 1 tablespoon of salt, and 2 teaspoons of pepper into the fat in the pan
                  and cook over medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally until the onions are lightly
                  browned.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more.  Add the Cognac, <em>stand back</em>, and ignite witha match to burn 
                  off the alcohol.  Put the meat and bacon back into the pot with any juices that have accumulated on the plate 
                  .  Add the wine plus enough beef broth to almost cover the meat.  Add the tomato paste and thyme.  Bring to a boil, cover the pot
                  with a tight fitting lid and place it in the oven for 1 1/4 hours, until the meat and vegetables are very tender
                  when pierced with a fork.  Remove from the oven and place on top of the stove.
              </li>
              <li>Combine 2 tablespoons of the butter and the flour with a fork and stir into the stew.  
                  Add the frozen onions.  In a medium pan, saute the mushrooms in the remaining 2 tablespoons of 
                  butter then add to the stew.  Bring the stew to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer uncovered
                  for 15 minutes.  Season to taste.
